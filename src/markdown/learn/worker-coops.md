## What's a worker co-op?

There are many kinds of cooperatives, such as credit unions and co-op markets. But unlike other consumer-owned cooperatives, a worker cooperative is a business owned by the people doing the work.

A worker cooperative (or co-op) is a type of business that puts worker wellbeing and community benefit at the core of its purpose.

Workers own the business and determine how it is run, based on the principle of one person, one vote. The worker-owners typically earn dividends each year based on the amount of labor they contribute to the co-op.

Worker co-ops can be managed collectively or by an elected board of directors. The worker-owners are able to direct everyday operations through many different management structures.

Worker co-ops can employ non-owners, but employees are offered membership after a reasonable trial period.
