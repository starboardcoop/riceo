## Bread & Roses Printing

Bread & Roses started as a worker cooperative in the summer of 2019 and signed a union contract with the Teamsters that same year. Their services are extensive, including, but not limited to, graphic and web design, union printing, apparel, brand and political consulting, political campaign materials, and photography. They span as small as business cards and produce as large as billboards!

As a worker co-op, they say they are able to keep prices fair and affordable while paying sustainable wages to themselves, since they don’t have managers or a CEO.

The typical day working at Bread & Roses isn’t much different from a traditional workday. One key difference, the members say, is that being a worker co-op eliminates any fears of needing to compete with other staff members to get ahead. Everyone at Bread & Roses works collaboratively on projects.

Meetings of all the members are held when the co-op needs to make a big decision. They say the debating process can take some time, but they always reach a compromise that each member can agree on. Small day-to-day decisions happen quickly and naturally.

In addition to being paid hourly wages, the worker-owners vote at the end of every year how much of the business’s bank account to distribute to the members. So far, they have voted to keep the money in the business.

What are their thoughts on worker cooperatives in Rhode Island? ”Thanks to the work put in by Fuerza Laboral and The Rhode Island Center for Employee Ownership, we think that the prospects for worker co-ops are very good. They have done a great job at instituting laws that have paved the way for current and future cooperative start-ups and have helped incubate start-up cooperatives, including our own."
