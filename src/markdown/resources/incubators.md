## Co-op Incubators

If you're looking to get your worker cooperative off the ground, there are a number of co-op incubators in the Rhode Island area that are willing to help.

### [Fuerza Laboral / Power of Workers](https://www.fuerza-laboral.org/)
Based in Central Falls, Rhode Island, **Fuerza Laboral** runs the POWER Network Co-op Incubator program. The program is working to construct "a network of worker-owned co-ops that will provide living-wage employment instead of the low-wage, exploitative jobs typically reserved for immigrants and people of color."

### [CDI](https://cdi.coop/)
**The Cooperative Development Institute (CDI)** is the Northeast's source for co-op development assistance. They support not only worker co-ops, but also cooperative housing projects, grocery stores, and more.

### [Start.coop](https://start.coop)
**Start.coop** accelerates cooperative startups by giving them the training, financing, and technical assistance they need to hit the ground running. One of the most notable co-ops to graduate from the accelerator program is [Ampled](https://www.ampled.com/), a cooperative platform for supporting indie musicians.
