# Co-op Incubators

If you're looking to get your worker cooperative off the ground, there are a number of co-op incubators in the Rhode Island area that are willing to help.

## [Start.coop](https://start.coop)
Start.coop accelerates new cooperatives by giving them the training, financing, and technical assistance they need to hit the ground running. One of their most notable co-ops is [Ampled](https://www.ampled.com/), a cooperative platform for supporting indie musicians.

## [CDI](https://cdi.coop/)
The Cooperative Development Institute (CDI) is the Northeast's source for co-op development assistance. They support not only worker co-ops, but also cooperative housing projects, grocery stores, and more.
