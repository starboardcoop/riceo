# Financing
Although co-ops can sometimes get financing from a traditional lender, many banks are still not familiar with the cooperative model and therefore tend to deny loan applications. Some co-ops have seen success by each member taking out a loan individually, but this approach may not be ideal for everyone.

Luckily, there are non-profit organizations that exist specifically to finance co-op startups and conversions.

## [Shared Capital Cooperative](https://sharedcapital.coop/)
Shared Capital Co-op is a cooperative that lends to cooperatives. They have been active for the last 40 years and have financed more than 800 cooperative projects. Any type of co-op is eligible, but must become a member before being able to borrow.

## [The Working World](https://www.theworkingworld.org/us/)
The Working World is the largest lender of specialized co-op loans. In their own words, they build "cooperative businesses in low-income communities, using a groundbreaking model that combines non-extractive finance with tailor-made business support." The Working World also assists in converting existing businesses to worker co-ops.

## [Navigant Credit Union](https://navigantcu.org)
