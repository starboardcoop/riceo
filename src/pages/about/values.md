# Our Values

**We elevate the following values through activism, advocacy, and education.**

Equity for all in both senses of the word: fairness and shared ownership.

Everyone should have a say in the decisions that affect them.

Reciprocity and mutual exchange.

The principle of one person, one vote.

Surplus belongs to co-op members.

Work is the only producer of wealth. As Abraham Lincoln put it: 
> “Capital is only the fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first existed. Labor is the superior of capital, and deserves much the higher consideration.”
