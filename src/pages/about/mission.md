# Our Mission

##Vision
A democratic Rhode Island economy that advances equity in both senses of the word; fairness and shared ownership.

##Rationale
Together, employee-owned and democratic workplaces, also called worker cooperatives, increase the living standards for our citizens as well as stabilize and retain meaningful jobs for our state and our communities.

##Activities
Along with broadening capital ownership, the Rhode Island Center for Employee Ownership promotes democratic workplaces to allow for employee control of the workplace or enterprise.

We, along with partner organizations, help retiring owners sell their business to their employees, employee groups plan the purchase of a business, and entrepreneurs co-start worker cooperatives.

We promote awareness of the values of employee ownership, democratic workplaces and worker cooperatives. We work with local business leaders, public officials, employees, the media, students, teachers, nonprofits, and the general public.

##Objectives
- Raise awareness.
- Build institutional support for a democratic business sector.
- Create more employee ownership.
- Improve Rhode Islandâ€™s economy.
