# Conversions

Many worker co-ops start out as traditional businesses, but convert when their original owners decide to retire. There are a number of reasons to go this route:

### Tax benefits
Employers who sell their business to their employees can benefit from significant tax incentives.

### Continuing the legacy
Small businesses that sell to larger corporations are usually gutted or shut down, bringing the legacy of a local business to an unfortunate end. Converting to worker ownership ensures that the legacy lives on.

### Supporting communities
Keeping businesses owned by locals builds a more robust economy that is circular and sustainable, rather than extractive and exploitative.
